CST-105: Programming Exercise 2
The following exercise assesses your ability to do the following:
• Get data from the keyboard.
• Select appropriate variable types for a calculation.
• Utilize Java arithmetic operators.
• Output result data in a specified format.
• Demonstrate and explain your work.
Write the following programs. When you are finished, create a 3- to 5-minute video in which you
explain and execute your programs. Be sure to address any challenges encountered and new
information learned while completing the assignment.
1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a 5-digit positive integer. Using only the / and
% operations, compute each digit and display the sum of the digits. Here is a sample run
with the user input shown in red.
Enter a 5-digit positive integer: 30458
The sum of the digits is 3 + 0 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 20
2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. Convert
the temperature to degrees Celsius. Ten ask the user to enter a temperature in Celsius.
Convert the temperature to degrees Fahrenheit. The formulas needed are C = (F – 32) *
5/9 and F = 9/5*C + 32.

Here is a sample run of the program with user input shown in red.
Enter a Fahrenheit temperature: 100
100F is equivalent to 37.777…C
Enter a Celsius temperature: 100
100C is equivalent to 212F
3. Be sure to test your results carefully. Use a handheld calculator to see if your program
produces the same output. Refer to the rubric in LoudCloud prior to beginning this
assignment to become familiar with the expectations for successful completion.
